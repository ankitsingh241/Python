# Set is a collection of non repetitive elements.

a = {1, 3, 4, 5, 1}
print(type(a))
print(a)

# It is unordered, unindexed; you can not change the items.

# Important: This syntax will create an empty dictionary and not an empty set.
b = {}
print(type(b))

# An empty set can be created using the below syntax:
c = set()
print(type(c))
